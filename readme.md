Script Name: install-ca-certificates.rsc
Purpose: This script is designed to automatically download and install the Mozilla CA certificate (cacert.pem) on a Mikrotik router.
Functionality:
Download the CA Certificate: The script uses the /tool fetch command to download the cacert.pem file from the official Mozilla CA certificate repository (https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem).
Import the CA Certificate: After downloading the file, the script uses the /certificate import command to import the cacert.pem file as a CA certificate on the Mikrotik router.
Benefits:
Improved Security: By installing the Mozilla CA certificate, the router can verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
Enhanced Trust: The script ensures that the router trusts the Mozilla CA certificate, which is widely recognized and trusted across the internet.
Simplified Management: The script automates the process of downloading and installing the CA certificate, making it easier to manage and maintain the router's security configuration.
Usage:
Upload the Script: Upload the install-ca-certificates.rsc script to your Mikrotik router using the /tool fetch command or by manually uploading the file.
Run the Script: Run the script using the /script command to execute the script and download/install the CA certificate.
Note: This script is designed for Mikrotik routers running RouterOS 6.44.6 or later. If you're running an earlier version, you may need to modify the script or use a different approach.
By using this script, you can ensure that your Mikrotik router has the latest and most trusted CA certificate installed, which is essential for secure communication and trust in the internet.
